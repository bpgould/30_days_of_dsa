## Julia Notes

`Command + Shift + P` in vscode to open Julia shell

`]` to open pkg

`generate <project>`

`readdir()` is equivalent to `ls`

`cd("path")`

`Control + D` to exit julia shell

`joinpath(Sys.BINDIR, "julia")` will return path to executable (interpreter), then you can run `<path> <file>` from shell without REPL
